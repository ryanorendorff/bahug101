BAHUG 101
=========

This is the repository for the lectures for the Fall 2015 BAHUG 101 course.


How to compile
--------------

There is a make file inside each lecture that will compile the PDF. By
default `make` will create the PDF. This will require, at a minimum,
pandoc and a tex distribution with beamer.


How to run
----------

Each lecture also includes a main file to run the code in the lecture
(as an example).
